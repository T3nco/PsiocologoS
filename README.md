# Resume

This project involves the modernization of an existing web chat system, originally developed with technologies such as PHP, 
JavaScript and PHPMyAdmin as a database. The motivation for this modernization is to improve scalability, 
real-time responsiveness and the quality of technical support provided to system users.


1. Migration to Firebase:

Migrating the PHPMyAdmin database to Firebase will allow for greater scalability and real-time synchronization of chat messages.
Integration with Firebase Authentication will ensure a secure authentication process for users.

2. Integration with Azure AI Services:

Implementing an Azure AI-based tech support bot will enable smarter, faster responses to user questions.
Integration with Azure Speech Services will enable speech-to-text conversion to support voice messaging in chat.
